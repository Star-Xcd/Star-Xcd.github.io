## About Me

I'm Chendong Xin, an undergraduate researcher passionate about robotics. My interest in robotics starts when I participate the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) in my high school. (Our team number is 6907) I'm now in the Department of Automation in Tsinghua University, where I actively work in the field of robotic.

### Background

I am particularly interested in robotic manipulation and the real-world deployment of robot learning methods. My research focuses on enabling robots to achieve human-level accuracy and robustness in manipulation tasks. In the long term, I aim to advance the capabilities of dexterous manipulation for complex tasks through learning-based approaches, and to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world performance.

### Research Focus

My research interests lie in the intersection of robot learning and manipulation, including:

- Imitation learning and learning from human demonstration  
- Dexterous manipulation and contact-rich manipulation  
- Teleoperation systems
