I'm **Chendong Xin**, an undergraduate researcher passionate about advancing robotics and AI technologies. Currently pursuing my studies while conducting research in **robotic manipulation** and **human-robot interaction**. My interest in robotics starts when I participate the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) in my high school. (Our team number is 6907)

### Background

I am particularly interested in robotic manipulation and the real-world deployment of robot learning methods. My research focuses on enabling robots to achieve human-level accuracy and robustness in manipulation tasks. In the long term, I aim to advance the capabilities of dexterous manipulation for complex tasks through learning-based approaches, and to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world performance.

## Research Interests and Experiences

My work focuses on bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic capabilities:

🧠 **Learning from Demonstration** - Imitation learning to learn from human experts  
🤖 **Human-to-Robot Teleoperation** - Teleoperation algorithms and systems for data collection  
🖐️ **Dexterous Manipulation** - Developing methods for complex robotic hand control   
👁️ **Vision-Based Grasping and Manipulation** - Integrating computer vision with manipulation
