I'm **Chendong Xin**, an undergraduate researcher passionate about advancing robotics and AI technologies. Currently pursuing my studies while conducting research in **robotic manipulation** and **human-robot interaction**.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic capabilities:

🧠 **Learning from Demonstration** - Teaching robots through human demonstrations  
🤖 **Human-to-Robot Teleoperation** - Intuitive control interfaces for robotic systems  
🖐️ **Dexterous Manipulation** - Developing algorithms for complex robotic hand control   
👁️ **Vision-Based Grasping** - Integrating computer vision with manipulation planning
